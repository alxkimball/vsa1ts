# Single Page Applications (SPA)
##[From Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a user experience similar to that of a desktop application.

* web site
* application
* dynamic

The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application.

* compare to MVC
* can still look like separate pages
* commutes with server behind the scenes
